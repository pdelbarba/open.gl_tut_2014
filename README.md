open.gl_tut_2014
================

Some example code for quick and dirty opengl linux code with GLFW and GLEW based on the tutorial code at [open.gl]

Usage
-----
To build the project using cmake, first install cmake `sudo apt-get install cmake` or whatever your distro wants...

To do an out-of-source build:
```
cd open.gl_tut_2014
mkdir build

You can now run the project (from `build`) with `./main`
